## PDF-Generator: How to run
    Our project runs in fpdf library to generate pdf. Therefore, fpdf library should be installed. 
    For this, we recommend to install fpdf2 since it provides faster service than fpdf. 
    It can be done by this command.
    : pip install fpdf2

    If user does not have the virtual environment running, then try this command.
    : python3 -m venv ./

    When above command is done, user needs to activate vrtual environment, this can be done by this command.
    : source ./bin/activate

    To run the pdf-generator, be sure to your current directory is at pdf-generator since the images for the pdf-generator are in this folder.
